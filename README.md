## Description
Our capstone project is a Swing-based role-playing game inspired by classic fantasy adventures and built using the principles of Object-Oriented Programming. Players control a party of heroes, each represented as its own class with unique attributes and abilities.

The game features a fully designed party system, allowing multiple heroes to fight together against powerful enemies. Each hero can equip weapons, and every weapon has its own attack power that influences damage dealt during combat.

## ⚔️ The Lore of Eldoria

**The Setting**

Eldoria is a land shaped by primal forces. For generations, peace reigned until **Dreadlord Vargoth** corrupted the elemental balance. From the peak of **Blackspire**, he now commands a legion of shadows, threatening to plunge the world into eternal night.

**The Champions of Prophecy**

Ancient seers foretold that nine distinct paths of power must unite to challenge the darkness. Heroes from every discipline have answered the call:

*   **The Vanguard (Tanks):**
    *   🛡️ **Warrior:** The master of steel who breaks the front lines.
    *   ✨ **Paladin:** The holy knight who shields the weak with divine light.

*   **The Strikers (Physical DPS):**
    *   🏹 **Archer:** The eagle-eyed marksman with unmatched precision.
    *   🗡️ **Rogue:** The shadow in the night, striking where the enemy is weakest.

*   **The Elemental Mages (Magic DPS):**
    *   🔥 **Fire Mage:** Conjurer of destruction and roaring flames.
    *   ❄️ **Cryo Mancer:** Master of the frozen winds and binding ice.
    *   🌪️ **Aero Mancer:** Wielder of the tempest and the skies.
    *   🪨 **Earth Mage:** Shaper of the ground, crushing foes with nature's weight.

*   **The Protector (Support):**
    *   🌿 **Cleric:** The divine healer who restores life and safeguards the party.

**The Mission**
To defeat the Dreadlord, you must assemble your party and venture into the **Blackspire Dungeons**. Only by combining steel, stealth, divinity, and the four elements can the heroes shatter Vargoth's dark mantle and restore the dawn.
